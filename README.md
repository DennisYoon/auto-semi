# auto-semi
There have been times when writing code and moving to the next line can be annoying.

When we write a lot of parentheses, we hit the right arrow a lot or do a mouse click or press the end key which is far away, in order to press semicolon key.

Auto-Semi will prevent this inconvenience. What you have to do is just double-clicking `shift` key. It shows the same effect as pressing `end` -> `;` -> `enter` key.
